# ML_Clustering_K-Means_Spotify_Project

In this projectt:
- We load the Spotify music dataset from a 'df_audio_features_10.csv' file. 
- We select relevant features for clustering from the DataFrame.
- We perform K-means clustering using `KMeans` class from scikit-learn.
- The predicted cluster labels are added back into the original dataframe.
- Finally, we visualize clustered data using scatter plot where danceability and energy and liveness and loudness are plotted against each other and colored by their respective cluster.
